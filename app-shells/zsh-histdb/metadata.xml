  <longdescription lang="en">
This is a small bit of zsh code that stores your history into a sqlite3 database. It improves on the normal history by storing, for each history command:

    The start and stop times of the command
    The working directory where the command was run
    The hostname of the machine
    A unique per-host session ID, so history from several sessions is not confused
    The exit status of the command

It is also possible to merge multiple history databases together without conflict, so long as all your machines have different hostnames.
